# FINC305 Bloomberg Currency Analysis
I understand this is not a normal way of accessing bloomberg but I wanted to use this assignment as an opporiuntiy to learn how to apply my learnings from data-science courses to finincial analysis

### Steps to run code
1) Login to Bloomberg terminal
2) Create conda environment
   - Open Anaconda navigator and create an enviroment called `MNC` 
   - install the following packages: `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `jupyterlab`, and `blp` - you will have to add the `conda-forge` channel to find blp
3) Launch JuypterLab from Anaconda Navigator
4) Run the cells one at a time
